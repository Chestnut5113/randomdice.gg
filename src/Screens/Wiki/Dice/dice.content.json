ACTIVE Solar will attack a lot faster than INACTIVE solar and will deal the Base Attack Damage to the first enemy, then it starts stacking like the inactive solar, but instead of stacking base damage, it starts stacking splash damage.

At a certain point, the Sun Effect created on the enemy stops growing and will do a 'whip' effect. Damage Stacks can be stacked faster by giving him a Light Dice to shoot faster. Solar gets countered by Knight Boss, Magician Boss and Silence Boss, silence boss can be easily beaten by having a full board.
